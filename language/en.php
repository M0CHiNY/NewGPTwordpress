The setting of this value can vary depending on the intended use. For example, if you are using a language model as a game generator, a high temperature value may help you create more fun and diverse games. However, if you are using a language model as a news source, a low temperature value may provide more accurate and reliable news. Suggested: 0.6", "gpt-textdomain"),
